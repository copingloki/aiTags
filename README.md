The Photos folder includes some test images you can use

The main file runs the Cifar, VGG, and Colors files

The VGG file comes up with a word based on its datebase, the Cifar one does the same using its database

The Colors file uses k-means clustering to get the main color of the image, therefore deciding if it is light or dark
